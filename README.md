# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: [1]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Start by explaining the code logic in the imperative approach.
   - Mention each step of the process in the code.
   - Describe how the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
   - Discuss the use of variables to track the state and progress of the process.

2. **Emphasis on How:** Highlight how the imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished.
   - Point out the use of loops, conditions, and explicit instructions.
   - Discuss any mutable variables or states that change during execution.


Example #: [2]

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
   - Describe the cooking process in a high-level, abstract manner.
   - Emphasize that the code defines "what" should happen rather than "how" it should happen.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** Discuss the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.
   - Explain how the process steps are organized in a structured format.
   - Mention any abstraction layers or functions used to encapsulate actions.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
- Reflect on what you've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.
